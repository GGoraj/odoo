ReceiptScreen should display the Print Confirmation button as well as Stripe Confirmation preview
only if the Bank payment (card payment) was used on previous screen (Payment Screen).
First user clicks 'Send Payment Request' button after choosing type of payment 'Bank'.
Payment is then sent to the terminal and props are sent to ReceiptScreen switching 'stripeConfirmation' state to True.
